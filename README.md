# Earthquake-Detector-with-email-alert
This project detects vibrations using an ADXL335 accelerometer and Arduino Uno. When a vibration exceeds the threshold, the system triggers a buzzer and LED alert. A Python script also reads data from the Arduino via Serial and sends an email alert to notify the user in real-time.
